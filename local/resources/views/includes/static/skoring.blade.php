    <p>At Kinnect2 we want you to be recognised for your participation. We have come up with a mechanism to be able to track this via our very own Kinnect2 sKoring method.</p>

    <div class="skoring-title">How does it work?</div>

    <p>Each time you contribute, whether it is connecting your social streams to Kinnect2, posting an article/blog, sharing a link, sharing a query, starting a poll, starting a battle of the brands, sharing something from Kinnect2 to any social stream, participating in brand campaigns, commenting on any existing posts or the like you will gain Kinnect2 points that will automatically be added to your Kinnect2 sKore.</p>

    <div class="skoring-title">Why is this important?</div>

    <p>The higher your Kinnect2 sKore the better, as it will allow others to see how active you are on Kinnect2. You will also be able to accumulate certain badges for reaching certain points. You will receive points and badges for carrying out certain activities such as linking your other social medias to Kinnect2, and for communicating and contributing on Kinnect2.</p>

    <p>Kinnect2 will have its very own leader board with the most active users featured on Kinnect2, this will include those Kinnectors who have the highest Kinnect2 sKore.</p>

    <p>The Kinnect2 team are working on many more features that will enable you to utilise the points reached to participate in exclusive campaigns and much much more.</p>
    <p>We know you will enjoy communicating, collaborating and connecting, as well as getting rewarded as a result, so keep Kinnecting and watch this space :)</p>
