			<p>Ads on this website allow you to easily advertise any destination such as your Business, website, or even the content created by you on this site.<br/>
				Depending on your marketing objective, you can choose which ad package is right for you. You may choose to promote your content on the site by creating an ad for that content. Viewers of the ad will be able to “Like” that ad, which,  in turn, increase the number of likes of your content and propagate it in the social graphs. While some ad packages will entitle you to receive a maximum number of clicks on your ad, others may entitle you to views, or days.
